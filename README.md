## 💡 Inspiration

## 💻 What it does

## 🔨 How we built it

- React Js: For the frontend
- Firebase: For user authentication and database
- Three Js: For rendering 3D Models
- Tailwind CSS: For styling

## 📶 Domain registered with Domain.com

## ⛅ Use of Google Cloud

- We built The Night Sky's authentication system with Google Cloud's Firebase. We chose this because we wanted to make an application that was very very secure. We learned how robust & fast Google Cloud services are and seeing that Firebase had a free plan that was great for us student hackers, using Google Cloud was kind of a no-brainer.
- Additionally, Firebase Authentication provided a backend service, easy-to-use SDKs, and ready-made UI libraries, and the ability to authenticate using passwords, phone numbers, Google, Facebook and Twitter, and the like. Thus, implementation was easy and we are pretty sure we made it incredibly convenient for our users while keeping it secure.

## 🧠 Challenges we ran into

The biggest challenge was to rendering the 3D model and adding AR functionality to them, which I overcome using three js and echoAR.

## 🏅 Accomplishments that we're proud of
